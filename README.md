# Productive Summer
Students who are willing to start something this summer.  

## Mindset
Go through these basic tutorials and all courses. *The Numbered bullets should be followed in sequence, whereas unordered bullets can be done randomly*.  
The thing will get easy with practice always start is hard. My suggestion is that **`go through the official tutorial first, then try video playlist`**. It will help you to understand better.  
Some concepts will be entirely new and can be very hard to understand, give a tough fight try to understand one time two time five time but don't leave, you will understand things on the fly, Just dedicate time, and stay with problems.  

**What to start?**: Just start with anything at the end of the day will learn some logic building and will learn something which will surely stay with you. You can switch domains afterwards when you find your interest.  
**Official tutorial is hard to understand**: yes, I know that you will face this. The reason why I am pushing for documentation tutorials is that you need to learn how to read the documentation. When you will do a real project, reading will be the main key. **Copy Paste, Try to understand what is going on. Not understanding is completely fine, you will understand with videos when the creator will explain things.**

**Disclaimer**: I am no a guru of anything, I took some of these courses, I included some creators that I love, some just came on a random search.
This is not a combination of the greatest courses these are normal courses. I am not affiliated with any one of them.  

#### I AM WAITING FOR YOUR PR, PLEASE.

## Web Development
These are more than concepts and understanding terminologies. Backend generally needs critical thinking, logic building, and connecting things. Frontend needs designing, displaying and connecting things.
1. [How web works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQ1tFLwldY)
2. [HTTP Request and Response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxiRFwQ1RJ4&t=21s)
3. [What is Rest API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVTAB8Z2VmA)

### Frontend development
The workflow that I will suggest that do [Basic](#basic-needed-for-all) and then move to [React](#react) (because that is easy to start with) then come to [Basic Level 2](#basic-level-2).

#### Basic [Needed for all]
1. [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp): The skeleton
2. [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp): The beauty
3. [JS Basic](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp): The logic

This is a basic portion for anyone interested in frontend development. I guess a good read for HTML, seeing some examples of CSS and trying some of JS will do. Don't get stuck here for long.

#### React
**A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.**  
React is powerful yet simple, you need to learn only concepts and then it is super easy to use.

1. [Get started with official tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFaFIcGhPoM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDvn0w86itw&list=PLYxzS__5yYQmD7FV1YYz9UxPyGTNsFObp)
3. Project: ToDo Application

**React does only one thing that is building user interfaces.** For other thing need for a full-fledged application you need to dig into its ecosystem.

Important concepts to learn:
1. [State and Props](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27991366/what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props-in-react)
2. [Component Lifecycle](https://hackernoon.com/reactjs-component-lifecycle-methods-a-deep-dive-38275d9d13c0)
3. Creating Reusable Components
4. [JSX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fPXI_MnBOY)

Some Advanced concepts:
1. [Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np8A_aW7Pew)
2. [React with Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bMTJxvEJiE&list=PL55RiY5tL51rrC3sh8qLiYHqUV3twEYU_&index=4)
3. [Routers](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
4. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Although this has nothing to do with react but is very frequently used.

#### Angular
1. [Get started with official tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eWrpsCLMJQ&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhBRAgFinJR8KHIrCdTkZcZ)

I haven't worked with angular yet, I would love for your pull request.

#### Basic Level 2
Now JavaScript generally means combined with node.

- [ES6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYk4N6kNups&list=PLYxzS__5yYQkoBSq0lA2fNWzN_O8efTMF&index=2&t=0s)
- [npm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fj0cpmMiVg&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhgWwm5J3KqzX47n7dwWNrq)
- [Javascript ES6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlfrWbYk1v0&list=PLRAV69dS1uWTSu9cVg8jjXW8jndOYYJPP&index=1): The creator is a bit slow and the course is lengthy but is worthy.

#### Design Concepts
This is UI/UX part of an application. Frontend applications are not only for working they should look good.
- [Adobe XD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_42MzdYbx2o&list=PLRAV69dS1uWSUAYohDFYhn24WgfnpzzNF)
- [Graphics Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWf1LpUnYmU&list=PLpQQipWcxwt9U7qgyYkvNH3Mp8XHXCMmQ)
- [Design languages](https://design-languages.com/)

Designing is a large topic and require more experience than coding, see more and more design on [behance](https://www.behance.net), watch

### Backend Development
#### Flask
Flask is easy and simple, used for simple to more complex applications.

1. [Get started with official tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH)
3. [Rest api with flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTZiDnuC86g)

#### Django
Django is powerful and very organised, get started with Django can be a little overwhelming, so I would suggest that first complete [Flask](#flask) tutorial and then try hands with Django (you can start with Django, no problem at all, but flask will help you understand the need and core concept of Django).

1. [Get Started with official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK): Although this tutorial is in Django 1.9 core concepts remain same.
3. Project: Blog App

Django Rest Framework
1. [Get started with official tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/)
2. [Get Started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d-zaQ69-5s&list=PL1WVjBsN-_NJ4urkLt7iVDocVu_ZQgVzF)

[Django Cookbook for advanced users](https://books.agiliq.com/en/latest/): You will need this when developing a real-world application

#### Express
Express is a popular web framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the Node.js runtime environment.
It is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.

2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2dKL2YrR1U&list=PLYxzS__5yYQmHbpKMARP04F344zYRX91I&index=14)
3. [Rest API with Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ka5fYysBM)

#### Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails is the web framework that started it all. Launched over 13 years ago, it popularised web development and made it cool. It is a very powerful framework, that is incredibly easy to use and learn and can do anything you want it to. A lot of current popular frameworks like Django are inspired by Ruby on Rails.
1. [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com): This is the best course for learning Ruby on Rails, and is arguably the only course you'll need for it. It will teach you fullstack development in Ruby on Rails, i.e. backend, frontend, databases, testing and everything in between. You are basically empolyable after finishing this course.

#### PHP Backend
PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
1. [Get Started with W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/php7/default.asp)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKWqdp17BFo&list=PLfdtiltiRHWHjTPiFDRdTOPtSyYfz3iLW&index=1)

#### Laravel
Laravel is one of the most popular PHP framework used across the globe to build web application ranging from small to big projects. It follows MVC (Model View Controller) structure which makes it easy to learn and rapidly prototype the web applications.

2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU7PRmCpx-0&list=PLillGF-RfqbYhQsN5WMXy6VsDMKGadrJ-)


## Cloud Computing and Security
### Get started with AWS
- [Udemy Course AWS with Django](https://www.udemy.com/share/100nwIBEEbcldWQn4=/): Django only is at some part of the tutorial, I loved this course because it covers the whole architecture and is a great basic start.
- [Understanding the Complex](https://www.udemy.com/share/10009iAEYceF9SQHQ=/): I haven't taken this course myself but going through syllabus it seems to be very much useful.
- [AWS for developers](https://www.udemy.com/share/1000viAEYceF9SQHQ=/): This is great for start and also DevOps.  

Take one of these 3 courses to go with, you will understand what to do next. All three courses are different in some way.

- [Server-less APIs](https://www.udemy.com/share/1001DoAEYceF9SQHQ=/)
### System design
I love [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quLrc3PbuIw&list=PLMCXHnjXnTnvo6alSjVkgxV-VH6EPyvoX) tutorials for understanding system design basics.

### Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking
- [Web bug bounty](https://courses.learncodeonline.in/learn/Ethical-Hacking-Master-Course-Web-Bug-Bounty-from-scratch?tab=1): This is good for a backend developer, I took this course and was basic and good I guess, but is little outdated.
- [Ethical Hacking](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013kMAEYceF9SQHQ=/)

Take any of the two above course for getting started with basics. They have the same topics.

- [Basics of Cyber Security](https://www.udemy.com/share/1000AiAEYceF9SQHQ=/)
- [Network security](https://www.udemy.com/share/100240AEYceF9SQHQ=/)

## Data Structures and Algorithm
### Core Concepts
Core concept of Data structures are same for every language.
- [On Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/): This is quite cool which covers the concepts with Pseudo-code.
### With Python
[Mit OCW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) Course is great if you can dedicate time.  
### With C/C++
I found this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92S4zgXN17o&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P) useful.   
## Machine Learning AI NLP
1. To get started with Machine Learning first course you need to do is [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
Complete the assignments for maximum outcome from this course.
2. For Mathematics and Statistics, Youtube Channel like [Mathematical Monk](https://www.youtube.com/user/mathematicalmonk) can be preferred.
3. For understanding [Linear Algebra : Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B) and how [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) and [Differntial Equations :  Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) try these playlists. Channel [3 Blue 1 Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) gives good visual animations to understand these concepts easily.
4. For specialization in Machine Learning and Deep Learning complete all these [Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) in specialization pragramme with assignments.
5. For some real world projects [Fast.ai](fast.ai) and [Applied AI Course](https://www.appliedaicourse.com/) are preffered.
6. At last for learning more and more daily try reading as much research papers as possible.

### Data analytics
1. Before going into the topics of Data Analytics one needs to clear the basics of Statistics. To brush up that here is a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlz0muypSBNYknvzMnyQd37CFEzpVXQGZ) to help you out.
2. Once you're done with the basic of statistics, you need to install a few pip files to get started with Data Analytics on Python. Given below are the necessary pip files you need to install.
3. Pandas: Pandas is an open source tool for Python, which helps in Data Structures and Data Analysis. To install Pandas you need to do [this](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
4. The next Important tool is installing MatPlotLib. MatPlotLib is another open source library that allows you to generate plots, histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, box plots, etc. To install matplotlib do [this](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html).
5. While most of the IDEs come with NumPy already installed if you have any problem with NumPy do [this](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
6. Once you have set up all the necessary files, you can start with the below tutorials:
[Pandas Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuASpe-1LjfG5f14Bnozjwy)
[Data Analysis with Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDc-3szzjeP6N6b0aDrrKyL-)
[MatPlotLib Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfefDfXb9Yf0la1fPDKluPF)
You can also look at this course from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python)

## App Development
### React Native
First learn basic [JavaScript](#basic-needed-for-all) and also [ES6 Syntax](#basic-level-2). All core concepts like JSX, Redux is same for [React](#react) and React Native.

1. [Get Started with official tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)
2. [Get Started with Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMoXvr0Q9LE&list=PLYxzS__5yYQlHANFLwcsSzt3elIbYTG1h)

React Native can be frustrating while installing, I will highly recommend starting with **Expo**, which is under the tab `Expo CLI Quickstart` on page [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

Read [why not expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/introduction/why-not-expo/) and if you feel so then use `React Native CLI`. Installation is given on tab `React Native CLI Quickstart`. **Follow the installation step by step and line by line**, do not skip or do anything else other than what is given, even do not try to mess with versions, just do what is said.  

React Native is not self-sufficient, it needs more modules for little advanced uses.
1. [Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np8A_aW7Pew)
2. [React Native with Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcC8KZ_Ga2M&list=PLy9JCsy2u97m3nSbw0xzo-X4EEoZiikd8)
3. [React Navigation V2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIq0vzDdJQ&list=PLy9JCsy2u97nn0Yrf3ioMbRL7guVlzk9d)
4. [React Navigation V3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MePfTc_PgzQ&list=PLy9JCsy2u97kiHGp2USF5SKAfz93WwLuh): First see V2 then jump to this
5. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Although this has nothing to do with react but is very frequently used.

### Flutter
1. [Get started with official tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/reference/tutorials)
2. [Get started with video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDwCQc2uEfw&list=PLRAV69dS1uWT-ooTYHCqgxMTGA233JMrP)

2. [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1000dOAEYceF9SQHQ=/): This course is best that I could find, but is lengthy. I recommend this to all level of students, beginners to advanced.
### Ruby
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming): This is probably the best Ruby course there is. It teaches Ruby using the concept of learning by doing (which, in my opinion, is the best way yo learn programming), i.e. you learn concepts by building projects using what you just learnt.

### Swift
Swift is the newest programming language and is easy to understand if you have basic concepts like Arrays and Function etc. Get Started with [Apple's Guided Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html).
